### ⛔️ Removed `auto-light-dark-mode-fill` UI icon

Please use `auto-light-dark-mode` instead.

### ✨ AI Experiences

#### ⚠️ Potentially breaking changes

The `new` and `new-fill` UI icons have been updated and are no longer using the "sparkle" metaphor. Therefore, this may potentially break implementations and/or uses of `new` or `new-fill` to symbolize AI experiences.

Where `new` or `new-fill` are used to symbolize AI experiences, please use one of our new AI icons instead:

- ai-experience
- ai-experience-fill
- ai-model
- ai-model-fill
